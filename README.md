# Analog-CMOS-Systems-and-circuits-for-2D-3D-Localization
This is a novel application of active analog circuits for computing the Cartesian coordinates of points ( targets ) in 2D and 3D space. Two anchors ( points ) are assumed available, with known coordinates. Optical or Infrared Angle-of-Arrival , AOA, (noisy) measurements from each anchor to the  uknown target are assumed available.
