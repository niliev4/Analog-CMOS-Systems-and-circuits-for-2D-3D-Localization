This is a novel application of active analog circuits for computing the Cartesian coordinates of points ( targets ) in 2D and 3D space. Two anchors ( points ) are assumed available, with known coordinates. Optical or Infrared Angle-of-Arrival , AOA, (noisy) measurements from each anchor to the  uknown target are assumed available. Linearized localization equations are derived for the case of small noise power,  and two types of active analog networks are formulated for solving the resulting equations. The first type is based on simultaneous (coupled)  algebraic equations and is solved via op-amps, DC voltages sources, and resistors.  The second type is based on simultaneous differential equations and is solved via OTAs, op-amps,  DC current sources, resistors and capacitors.  Simulation results are presented which show each type of  analog circuit converging to the targetâ€™s coordinates with an acceptable error.  Power dissipation performance is presented as well. It is found that the coupled algebraic equations circuit has a better mapping to the original AOA equations and a better convergence to the final coordinates voltages.
